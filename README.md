# Tic-Tac-Toe
This version of Tic-Tac-Toe was made using the basic built in Java GUI library, Swing.  My version of Tic-Tac-Toe features the classic 
game playable against a computer player.  The player can control the game by either using the numpad with each number/naviagtion keys representing the respective location on the board, or the player can use QWE ASD ZXC also representing the respective location on the board.  As for the three difficulties of computer player, for easy the computer chooses a location randomly, for normal the computer treis to block the player, and for hard difficulty the computer tries to win by making moves that benefit itself also for the hard diffuclty there is a chance that the computer starts rather than the player in vary the game.  This was the first game I made using Java and was made in 2014, so feel free to use the clone or download button to download the zip file and enjoy!
